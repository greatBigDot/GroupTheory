# GroupTheory
An attempt to create a data type and associated functions modelling the mathematical idea of "groups" from group theory. For the moment, I'm only trying to get finite groups working, but since it's easy to represent infinitely large data structures in Haskell, it might be feasible to get some functionality with infinite groups down the road.
